# Learning Project for repos and conda environment

In this repo, we learned how to:-
1. Name files appropirately 
2. Make sure files have the right extensions
3. Rename and order py scripts so the run in order
4. Create a environment,in this case, a conda virtual environment
5. Then, install packages and channels for it

Should tinker around it more like cloning and see if it can branch off nicely into a new project!
